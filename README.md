# Sales Trend Analyzer with Machine Learning

## 🎯 Overview
A sales forecasting system that predicts future revenue using Linear Regression built from scratch (no scikit-learn!). Uses only NumPy and Python to demonstrate understanding of ML algorithms at the mathematical level.

## 📊 Features
- Historical sales data analysis (12 months)
- Growth trend identification and visualization
- Future revenue prediction (3-month forecast)
- Business insights and actionable recommendations
- Performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, Accuracy)

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- *Python 3.x* - Core programming language
- *NumPy* - Numerical computing and array operations
- *Matplotlib* - Data visualization and charts
- *Linear Regression* - ML algorithm coded from scratch

## 📈 Results
- *Prediction Accuracy*: ~90%
- *Monthly Growth Rate*: Identified consistent upward trend
- *Forecast Range*: Successfully predicts 3 months ahead
- *Model Performance*: Low error rates (MAE < 3K)

## 💼 Business Value
